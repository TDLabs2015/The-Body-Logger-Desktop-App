# The-Body-Logger-Desktop-App
The Body Logger Desktop App to help human beings easily digitally log health problems.


Install instructions.

1) Download and unzip Body-Logger-Desktop-main_V1

2) Now we need to install some dependencies that make the software works that includes Python, Pip and then flask. Python is the biggest of these installs so start installing that first. 
Then we install Pip (this is just a tool that allows us to download many python dependencies easily). Once PIP is successfully installed we now install Flask, 
which is specifically what we use in the Body logger for its backend server database functions.
This video shows how to install Python, Pip and flask (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxZuFm5tmhM).

3) Now to run the Body logger app,

You can find the index.html file in the templates folder. Right click and make a shortcut link by going to the "Send To" menu. This will send a shortcut link to your desktop which you can now place anywhere in your system conveniently.
You should also place the original Body logger folder somewhere safe and rememberable, whether that be your documents folder or somewhere else. Remember this is the folder that your original CSV database of info is contained along with code that make the app run.
When you execute the index.html file the body logger will launch in your preferred web browser. 
Hereâ€™s a tip! Download a new browser other than what you use and organize it (in settings) so that the body logger is the only thing you use it for. 
This way you can easily have the browser save the body logger media and CSVS into one folder instead of being scattered in your main downloads folder.
Your browser will also load up to your preferred size on your screen and overall this is a great way to have the body logger be reliable and self-contained.
